## 🎯 Key Points to Emphasize

1. **Self-Sovereign:** "Users own their identity"
2. **Decentralized:** "No central server, documents on IPFS"
3. **Privacy:** "Selective disclosure - share only what's needed"
4. **Verifiable:** "On-chain verification, can't be faked"
5. **Revocable:** "Issuers can revoke when needed"

## 🚨 If Something Breaks

**If transaction fails:**
- "This is a demo environment, but in production..."
- Show the UI/flow anyway
- Explain what would happen

**If IPFS is slow:**
- "IPFS uses public API, in production we'd use our own node"
- Show mock hash if needed

**If MetaMask doesn't connect:**
- Have screenshots ready
- Explain the flow verbally

## 📝 One-Liner Summary

"PixelLocker is a decentralized identity system where users control their credentials, documents are stored on IPFS, and selective disclosure allows privacy-preserving verification."

Good luck! 🎉
